Payday loans do not eliminate overdraft risk, and for 27 percent of borrowers, they directly cause checking account overdrafts.
More than half of payday loan borrowers have overdrafted in the past year. In addition, more than a quarter report that overdrafts occurred as a result of a payday lender making a withdrawal from their account. Although payday loans are often presented as an alternative to overdrafts, most payday borrowers end up paying fees for both.
